    "From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram):\n",
    "\n",
    "An anagram is direct word switch or word play, the result of rearranging the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once; for example, the word anagram can be rearranged into nag-a-ram. Someone who creates anagrams may be called an \"anagrammatist\".[1] The original word or phrase is known as the subject of the anagram. Anagrams are often used as a form of mnemonic device as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any word or phrase that exactly reproduces the letters in another order is an anagram. However, the goal of serious or skilled anagrammatists is to produce anagrams that in some way reflect or comment on the subject."

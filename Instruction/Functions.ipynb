This is great if you want to perhaps change one thing and run a bunch of lines of code again with that one thing changed. But what if we want to run the same cell a whole bunch of times? Or what if we want one cell to be able to run the code that's in another cell? Functions allow us to do these things and really help with the organization (and therefore readability) of our code."

    "At it's most basic level, a function is something that accepts inputs, and produces outputs. Think of a function as a factory. It takes some number of raw ingredients, and spits out a finished product or products. We can give functions names just like we give variables names. The inputs that a function works with are normally written in parentheses after the name of the function. So let's say we have a function named f that takes 2 inputs, which we'll temporarily call a and b. Then we write f(a,b). f takes a and b and produces something. Let's say it produces one thing and let's call it c. Then we can write f(a,b) = c."
